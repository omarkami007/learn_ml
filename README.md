# ML algorithms in depth from scratch
This repo documents my journey in implementing ML algorithms, Ideally i would like to include a short theoritical 
overview of the algorithm (latex markdown), then an implementation of the algorithm "naively/from scratch" without pre-defined ML functions, then a conventional implementation using the known libraries
