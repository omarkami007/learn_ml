# ML algorithms in depth from scratch
This repo documents my journey in learning ML; The codes are organized in notebooks for each major concept (decision trees, Svm..). Ideally, the notebooks should be organized as follows:
1) Short theoritical overview of the algorithm (latex markdown)
2) Implementation from scratch without pre-defined ML functions
3) Implementation implementation using the conventional functions from the known libraries
